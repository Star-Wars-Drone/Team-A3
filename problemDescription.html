<h1>ECE 492/592: Introduction to Autonomous Systems</h1>
<h2>Team A3: Pop a Red Balloon</h2>
<h3>Problem Description:</h3>
<p>The main goal of this project is to develop and implement the code required for the drone (UAV) or (UGV) to automatically find and pop a red balloon. (Or some other relatively easy to identify (and destroy) object, but which must first be visually found.). To this end, a video camera is connected to the drone and video processing is used to first detect the red balloon, and then to navigate the drone in the right direction to pop the balloon with the propellers of the drone (or a poker if a UGV is used). The location of the target will change as the drone moves, but this can be compensated by receiving IMU information (pitch, roll), either from the autopilot, or from a separate IMU.</p>
